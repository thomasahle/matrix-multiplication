/-!+# The square weights in auxiliary separation

Sections 4.1–4.3 use the phase `u - v + 2 * (g - h)` to select monomials.
On a selected monomial, the three integer variable weights add to `(g - h)^2`.
Thus the surviving monomials have nonnegative total degree, although individual
variable weights may be negative. Their degree is zero precisely when the guess
`g` matches the sector `h` and the auxiliary labels agree.
