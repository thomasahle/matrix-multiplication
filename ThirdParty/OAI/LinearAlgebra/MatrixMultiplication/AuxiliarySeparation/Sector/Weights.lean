# Interval weights for the three-sector convolution degeneration

Section 5.2 assigns weights to the second and third coordinates of
`C(a, 3 * h + a - 1)`. The total weight is nonnegative on convolution support,
and its zero set consists exactly of the three matching sector blocks.
The middle block is a convolution with the last two legs exchanged and the
first coordinate reversed.
